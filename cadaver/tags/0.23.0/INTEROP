Known interop problems:

mod_dav (0.9.14)

- Collection locking broken
(fixed in mod_dav-0.9.15): If a lockowner is sent, 'discover' and 'steal'
will fail on the resource.

IIS (as at dav.ics.uci.edu)

- Can DELETE a LOCK'ed resource without submitting locktoken
(fixed in cadaver-0.11.0): All methods broken, sending empty If: header

webfolders.mydocsonline.com

- MKCOL fails 501
- COPY creates a duplicate resource in the collection, with the same name as
the *original* resource. It also appears some kind of ghost resource
appears at the Destination, which PROPFIND reports is a DAV:collection...
- PROPFIND on a non-existent resource gives a 500 error, should be 404.

www.driveway.com

(fixed in cadaver-0.11.0) 'ls' broken due to unwanted properties in 
PROPFIND response
- MKCOL fails 500
- COPY returns 204 but doesn't copy anything
- GET/PROPFIND against non-existent resource gives 422, should be 404.

Zope

- Several reports about problems against Zope 2.1, but nobody will
send me details!

PyDAV (sandbox.xerox.com:8080)

- Broken due to use of "Keep-Alive: " request-header field with no value.

(fixed in cadaver-0.11.0): Extra newline after request body broke any
requests with bodies.
(fixed in cadaver-0.12.0): 'lock' and 'discover' broken due to missing
Content-Type header in requests.
(fixed in cadaver-0.12.0): 'lock' broken due upper-case I in infinity.
