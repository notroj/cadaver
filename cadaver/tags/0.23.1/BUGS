* 'propnames' has confusing output

* screwy for collections served by mod_dav_svn

* 'history' doesn't fail appropriately for 501 etc responses.

* mv hello/ jello
 -> fails with 301 on 2.0, no trailing slash on dest

* doesn't care about the standard $http_proxy environment variable
 (wget e.g. honors this)

* the -p option isn't documented (neither in the manpage nor
with -h).
