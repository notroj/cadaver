Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

-> Why this horrible name? 

It's a play on words: WebDAV - DAV - caDAVer. Gettit?

-> Why not something... nicer?

Suggestions are very welcome: if you can come up with something
better, I'm willing to change the name.

-> Why doesn't the "edit" command work with gvim?

Because gvim forks and runs in the background by default.  Set the
EDITOR environment variable to "gvim -f", or put in ~/.cadaverrc

  set editor "gvim -f"

to make the edit command work properly.

-> How do I read my HotMail e-mail using cadaver?

Run:

./cadaver -t http://law14.oe.hotmail.com/cgi-bin/hmdata/foobar@hotmail.com/folders/ACTIVE/

replacing 'foobar' with your real account name. Login when prompted
using your username (without @hotmail.com) and your password.  Then
use 'ls' and you'll get a mailbox listing.  Use 'less' or 'cat' to
display message contents. 'cd ..' to get a list of your folders.

You MUST use the '-t' switch to cadaver since the HotMail servers
support a specific subset of DAV operations.  You MUST also have
built against libxml, otherwise you get XML encoding errors.

-> That's a really horrible way of reading e-mail though

Yup. Now go add WebDAV support to fetchmail.
