* New command line parser: 
  - handles quotes, so you can do "rm 'foo bar'"
  - backslash literal escaping, so you can do "rm foo\ bar"
  - and BASIC globbing on remote filenames. These will only match
    against the contents of the current collection, so, for instance,
    "../*.html" will NOT WORK as intended. Note also that patterns
    are never matched against LOCAL filenames.
* New 'echo' command, to test how a globbing pattern expands.
* move, mkcol, less, cat, delete can all take multiple arguments.
  Usage, e.g.: "mkcol a b c d e", "rm *.html", "mv *.html /elsewhere"

* Readline history support.
* Default to '/' if no path given on 'open', or at startup.
* 'open' only succeeds for real DAV-enabled collections (i.e., ones where
  OPTIONS returns '1' in the 'DAV:' header).
* New commands: move, copy, (both with overwrite: f) cat, less.
* Won't prompt for username/password twice if you get it wrong the 
  first time.
* ~/.netrc support, compile-time option, use not recommended since 
  your DAV password on a machine probably isn't the same as your FTP password.
* Misc bug fixes and cosmetic tidyups.

Changes in release 0.2.0:
* Allow startup with no hostname/path
* New commands: open, close, get, put, mkcol, delete
